<p>You will use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheetplan">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> to describe a software architecture model about your own project.</p>
<p>This document will grow during the semester as you sketch and refine your software architecture model.</p>
<p>When you are done with each task, please push so we can give you feedback about your work.</p>
<p>We begin by selecting a suitable project domain.</p>
<h1 id="ex---domain-selection"><span class='task'>1.</span>  Domain Selection</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>Submit the name and brief description (about 100 words) of your domain using the following vision statement template:</p>
<pre><code>For [target customers] 
Who [need/opportunity/problem]
The [name your project]
Is  [type of project]
That [major features, core benefits, compelling reason to buy]
Unlike [current reality or competitors]
Our Project [summarize main advantages over status quo, unique selling point]
</code></pre>
<p>Please indicate if your choice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a project you have worked on in the past (by yourself or with a team)</li>
<li>a project you are going to work on this semester in another lecture (which one?)</li>
<li>a new project you plan to build in the future</li>
<li>some existing open source project you are interested to contribute to</li>
</ul>
<p>The chosen domain should be unique for each student.</p>
<p>Please be ready to give a 2 minute presentation about it (you can use a slide but it&#39;s not necessary)</p>
<section class="hint"><span>Hint: </span>to choose a meaningful project look at the rest of the modeling tasks which you are going to perform in the context of your domain.</section></section><p>Project Name: <em>Local Guide</em></p>
<p>Project Type:</p>
<p>Vision Statement:</p>
<p>For [target customers] Youth, people under 30 years, essentially newcomers who are planning to shift to Lugano</p>
<p>Who [need/opportunity/problem]</p>
<p>Google maps exists, but it exhibits a very global outlook on everything. You might see a lot of supermarkets in the search list, but what about the cheapest one? Or the one with the best quality? Results are vast, but often not very  precise. Not only that, Google searches can get messy, require a lot of memory retention on users part, for someone who has never set foot in foregin land - settling down can become a nightmare. Having observing students on various groups and forums, despite the vast amount of info available on the internet, many people remain clueless about the most basic needs, which in fact are the most important ones. For that purpose,such apps are the need of the hour, as the summarize the exact information an individual may require.</p>
<p>The Local Guide</p>
<p>Is  [type of project] a mobile application</p>
<p>That [major features, core benefits, compelling reason to buy]</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinct categories for each necessity, : transportation, clothes, furniture, shopping, medical, financial,work related etc</li>
<li>Basic info for every category will be listed, most common banks, mobile network providers, waste management rules etc</li>
<li>All categories have the best option listed for them, and links provided for more additional info</li>
<li>Language mode so users are able to read at their own comfort</li>
<li>Filters for every option based on: prices, distance, quality ratings (given by the users)</li>
<li>Users can compare prices of items between two shops</li>
<li>Users will be offered incentives, discounts to motivate them to review places visited by them more</li>
<li>As a future prospect: to add modes in the app, traveler and new settler mode: to help personalize the users experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this app?</p>
<p>Shifting to a new country is a very different experience, something that no one can ever be fully well prepared for - what more could someone yearn for than a curated view of the best options for your basic amenities? Local Guide gets you exactly that - be it anything you want to know, best insurance, best bank to open an account in, cheap shopping options - everything is there in the app. Everyone knows the big names, but what the local shops, that don&#39;t turn up in the google search results, that actually keep relevant stuff - is what this app focuses on.</p>
<p>Unlike [current reality or competitors] Google Maps</p>
<p>Our Project [summarize main advantages over status quo, unique selling point]
More localized view of things, considering a students point of view - keeping in mind their budget and all the basic amenities that one needs in a new place. Removes the need to search for multiple things one at a time, all the information is available for you in one single app</p>
<p>Additional Information:</p>
<p>This is a new project I plan on implementing in the future.</p>

<h2 id="adr-1--implementation-of-offline-mode">ADR 1 : Implementation of Offline Mode</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>Database: Realm Database</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>The main aim of this decision is to find the most beneficial and optimal solution that takes into consideration the functionalities of the Local Guide app. The main requirement that is into focus, is that the data and the user interface of the application should be made available to the user at all times,with or without network connection.</p>
<p>What is the goal you are trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Allow users to access all the UI and information of the app offline.</p>
<p>What are the constraints?</p>
<p>Limitation on a single string&#39;s length.</p>
<p>What is the scope of your decision? Does it affect the entire architecture?</p>
<p>The decision impacts the entire architecture as the selection of the database is of prime importance, because it will be the main storage for all the data required for the mobile app.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>How can I give the users the benefit of accessing the information at all times?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>SQLite Database</li>
<li>CoreData</li>
<li>Realm Database</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Realm Database</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>It fulfills the main purpose of the application, to give users the feature to access all the information even when offline, in scenarios where there is no access to data or Wifi and also it is fully compatible with Java, which will be used to develop the mobile app. </p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Essentially designed for offline use as it can handle the unpredictability concerning mobile apps, such as lost connections, devices being shut down at unfavorable timings and so on. As it is offline first, it is always read from and written to the local database and not over the network.</li>
<li>As this is a local guide app, the most important component will the keeping the UI in sync, realm used live objects which always reference the most up-to-date data on disk when accessed. </li>
<li>As it runs on the client devices, storing, accessing and updating the data is simple.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>As Realm offers many features, it consequently requires a bit more effort for implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adr-2--programming-language">ADR 2 : Programming Language</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>Language: Java</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>The main purpose of this decision was to find the suitable programming language that will be compatible with the database selected in the previous decision.</p>
<p>What is the goal you are trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Compatibility with database and development of mobile app.</p>
<p>What is the scope of your decision? Does it affect the entire architecture?</p>
<p>The decision applies to the entire project and is of upmost importance.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>How can we find a suitable language that interoperates with the chosen database?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Kotlin</li>
<li>Dart</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Java</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Java</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>Java has one of the most intensive support available, which makes it better for the team to develop the application. Plus, as the project requires several other API&#39;S such as geo location services,language translators, database functions, java fulfills the goal.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Versatile to integrate distinctive apps and functions</li>
<li>Secure environment for design and development</li>
<li>Has a lot of built in tools and rich set of library.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes longer time to run</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adr-3--monetization-model">ADR 3 : Monetization Model</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>Model: Combination of In app purchases and Sponsorship</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose to be looked into is how will the app be monetized after its post deployment stage.</p>
<p>What is the scope of your decision? Does it affect the entire architecture?</p>
<p>The scope of this decision extends to the post deployment stage of the application</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>What will be the revenue generation strategy of the app?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In-App Advertising</li>
<li>Pay to download apps</li>
<li>Paywalled Content</li>
<li>Transactions Commissions</li>
<li>Subscriptions</li>
<li>In app purchases</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Combination of the subscription and in app purchases model.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for selecting the combination is to divide the monetization into two different strategies, as one strategy can often prove to become outdated after some time, or not favorable for the business.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-app purchases help in promotions of the application&#39;s unique functionalities</li>
<li>Subscriptions are beneficial to users in the long run, which in turn increase good word of mouth for both the app and the businesses connected with it</li>
<li>Reduced costs of acquiring new customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>The revenue generation process could be a bit slow and time consuming, as it takes time to build the loyalty of customers.</li>

<p>Developing an app natively for each OS is expensive and time consuming, but it benefits from a good performance. Choosing a cross-platform environment on the other hand simplify the development process, making it faster and cheaper, but it might suffer in performance.</p>
<h1 id="trade-offs">Trade-offs</h1>
<h2 id="extensibility-and-design-consistency">Extensibility and Design Consistency</h2>
<p>In order to keep the operations simplified and easier to identify for the users, a same design pattern needs to be maintained, across all the different screens of the application - so that users do not get confused when trying out different alternatives in the app. Keeping design consistent does hold up customer’s expectations but for future prospects, growing the architecture further will put a lot of constraints on the development of the app and more time and effort in implementation.</p>
<h2 id="customizability-and-composability">Customizability and Composability</h2>
<p>Creating a lot of customizations for the users in the application will make the app more useful and assist them in more advanced levels, but it would require many sub components and interconnections within the app which would lead to utilization of  a lot of resources and increment of development costs.</p>
<h2 id="adaptability-and-performance">Adaptability and Performance</h2>
<p>As an application that works as a guidebook for the users, one of the prime advantages is that it can be highly adaptable to the user’s preferences, interests, and new trends in the market, but as the complexity increases, it will overload the development process, leading to possible reductions in performance.</p>

</ol>
<p>It comprises all the features that will be implemented for the application, and as the app caters to the tourism industry, it needs to have an aesthetic appeal, and that particular purpose is fulfilled by Material’s pre-written code for different types of UI components.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduction of code, which would otherwise increase the workload if hardcoded in java</li>
<li>As it is developed by Google, makes it more easier to integrate with api’s efficiently</li>

<li>What did you decide?</li>

<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of this decision was to find another database which offers all the features as the previously selected one (Realm Database), and offers a method to integrate the Security component of the app within the database itself.</p>
<p>What is the scope of your decision? Does it affect the entire architecture?</p>
<p>As the database is the main component dealing with storage and querying, this decision impacts the entire structure of the application</p>
<ol start="3">

</ol>
<p>How can the selection of the database be maneuvered in such a way that it handles the security component and effortless integration with Google APIs? </p>

<p>The main purpose that will be served by firebase is integration of the security component within itself, and also as the developer has already experience with this technology, it will be less time consuming as compared to the previous decisions of Realm Database, which required everything to be learned from scratch.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a Google Cloud service, it also gives you access to other Google products and features, in this case the UI toolkit and api</li>

<p>For example the LG tuple space should interact with in/out/read instead of <code>retrieve sub category</code>, <code>send request for coordinates</code>.</p>
<p>It is unusual for connectors to directly connect between themselves without any intermediate component.</p>
<p>The process view indicates a direct interaction between Stripe and the Local Guide (details stored under relevant user id) which is not modeled in the connector view</p>
<p>In general the process view should be modeled using a more technical language to describe the content of the messages as opposed to natural language. This would make it much easier to map the connector primitives to the represented interactions between component/connectors.</p>
<p>The ADR do not discuss the choice of connector, but as in the previous assignment they explain why one API was selected out of many alternative ones.

<p>The goal is to fix the  mismatch for the transport sub component in the UI. </p>

</ol>
<p>API connector</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>The main reason for this selection is primarily the mismatch between the transport sub component of the interface,as there were no relevant shared databases as such to get the information, as for now the app is restricted to transportation within switzerland, and no other type of connector is valid for the interaction I wanted to show, so I decided to go ahead with the transport api which provides public transport within Switzerland. The API uses a web service provided by search.ch</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the api connector has the information for transport specific to switzerland, it helps to narrow down the work for the developer and eliminates the need to create a new component from scratch.</li>

<li><p>(1) Should we find cases where two components cannot communicate (and are doing it wrongly) and highlight they would need an adapter?, or cases where we have already a &quot;component playing the role of adapter in the view&quot; and highlight only the adapter?</p>
<p><em>Both are fine. We assumed that if you draw a dependency (or a connector) the interfaces match, but if you detect that the components that should communicate cannot communicate then of course introduce an adapter to solve the mismatch</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>(2) Please show the details about the two interfaces which do not match (e.g., names of parameters, object structures) so that it becomes clear why an adapter is needed and what the adapter should do to bridge the mismatch</p>
</li>
<li><p>(5-6) These questions are about the implications on coupling based on the decisions you documented in the connector view.
Whenever you have a connector you couple together the components and different connectors will have different forms of coupling</p>
<p>For example, if you use calls everywhere, do you really need them everywhere? is there some pair of components where you could use a message queue instead?</p>
<p>Regarding the coupling facets mentioned in question 5. You do not have to answer all questions related to &quot;discovery&quot;, &quot;session&quot;, &quot;binding&quot;, &quot;interaction&quot;, &quot;timing&quot;, &quot;interface&quot; and &quot;platform&quot; (p.441, Coupling Facets).

<h5 id="platform-independence">Platform Independence</h5>
<p>The architecture essentially is platform independent, as the database being used for the application is Firebase, which has support for quite a lot of languages: java, swift, kotlin etc. and also for both the platforms: web and android. In the future, if the implementation will have to be shifted to another language, the client side could only notice slight changes in the UI, but the internal functionality will remain the same.</p>
<h5 id="interaction">Interaction</h5>
<p>The interaction between user  and the external components cannot be indirect. Considering the first case, the user interface makes use of the firebase rest api which plays the role of an adapter pulling data from firebase and displaying to the end user.</p>
<h5 id="session">Session</h5>
<p>The interactions between the user and the app in general, does not depend on the previous selections made by the user, as there is no explicit save of user history, unless user turns on the preferences option in the settings.</p>

<h3 id="improvement-of-model">Improvement of Model</h3>
<p>I believe that the current model of the system is already exhibiting minimized coupling, the user interface has only two external dependencies, the database,payment gateway and transport. However in the payment option, instead of having the necessary adapter connect api (which enables creation of custom accounts in Stripe), this option can be kept optional thus leaving with only one api that is the Stripe API acting as the adapter.</p>
<section class="feedback"><p>Why do you write that the Stripe API acts as an adapter? What are the two interfaces which do not match and thanks to the Stripe API can successfully communicate?</p>
</section><h1 id="ex---physical-and-deployment-views"><span class='task'>12.</span>  Physical and Deployment Views</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>a. Extend your architectural model with the following viewpoints:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Physical or Container View</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deployment View</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your model should be non-trivial: include more than one physical device/virtual container (or both). Be ready to discuss which connectors are found at the device/container boundaries.</p>
<p>b. Write an ADR about which deployment strategy you plan to adopt. The alternatives to be considered are: big bang, blue/green, shadow, pilot, gradual phase-in, canary, A/B testing.</p>
<p>c. (Optional) Prepare a demo of a basic continuous integration and delivery pipeline for your architectural documentation so that you can obtain a single, integrated PDF with all the viewpoints you have modeled so far. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>configure a GitHub webhook to be called whenever you push changes to your documentation</li>
<li>setup a GitHub action (or similar) to build and publish your documentation on a website</li>
</ul>

<p>Pilot</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>

<p> What will be the most suitable deployment strategy for an app catering to the needs of a particular target audience locally?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>

<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Pilot</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>The pilot is somewhat closely related to the big bang appraoch, but offers a slight different insight. With this strategy, instead of going live all at once, the application is deployed to a small and targeted group of users who can use the system in a controlled environment. This helps to gather user feedback, make changes and adjustments and improve the overall quality of the application.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If there are problems in the application, they are easier to catch and rectify if deployed initially to a limited set of users</li>
<li>A bit cheaper than having multiple versions in production, as only one version is in usage.</li>

<h1 id="ex---availability-and-services"><span class='task'>13.</span>  Availability and Services</h1>
<section class="instructions "><p>The goal of this week is to plan how to deliver your software as a service with high availability.</p>
<ol>
<li>If necessary, change your deployment design so that your software is hosted on a server (which could be running as a Cloud VM). Your SaaS architecture should show how your SaaS can be remotely accessed from a client such as a Web browser, or a mobile app</li>
<li>Sketch your software as a service pricing model (optional)</li>
<li>How would you define the availability requirements in your project domain? For example, what would be your expectation for the duration of planned/unplanned downtimes or the longest response time tolerated by your clients?</li>
<li>Which strategy do you adopt to monitor your service&#39;s availability? Extend your architecture with a watchdog or a heartbeat monitor and motivate your choice with an ADR.</li>
<li>What happens when a stateless component goes down? model a sequence diagram to show what needs to happen to recover one of your critical stateless components</li>
<li>How do you plan to recover stateful components? write an ADR about your choice of replication strategy and whether you prefer consistency vs. availability. Also, consider whether event sourcing would help in your context.</li>
<li>How do you plan to avoid cascading failures? Be ready to discuss how the connectors (modeled in your connector view) impact the reliability of your architecture.</li>
<li>How did you mitigate the impact of your external dependencies being not available? (if applicable)</li>

</li>
<li><p>How well does your architecture scale along the chosen dimension? Where do you expect the bottleneck to be?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modify your architecture to remove the scalability bottleneck you have identified (show both logical, process and deployment view) - consider whether the API/interface of the bottleneck component should be improved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write an ADR regarding the scalability pattern you have introduced.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write an ADR regarding the issue of component discovery, choosing one of the alternatives: dependency injection vs. directory. Can you identify an existing component playing the role of directory/dependency injection container? Could you give an example of where you would need to add such component to facilitate dynamic component discovery?</p>

<section class="instructions "><p>Only dead software stops changing. You just received a message from your customer, they have an idea. Is your architecture ready for it?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick a new use case scenario. Precisely, what exactly do you need to change of your existing architecture so that it can be supported? Model the updated logical/process/deployment views.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pick another use case scenario so that it can be supported without any major architectural change (i.e., while you cannot add new components, it is possible to extend the interface of existing ones or introduce new dependencies). Illustrate with a process view, how your previous design can satisfy the new requirement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change impact. One of your externally sourced component/Web service API has announced it will introduce a breaking change. What is the impact of such change? How can you control and limit the impact of such change? Update your logical view</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open up your architecture so that it can be extended with plugins by its end-users. Where would be a good extension point? Update your logical view and give at least one example of what a plugin would actually do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assuming you have a centralized deployment with all stateful components storing their state in the same database, propose a strategy to split the monolith into at least two different microservices. Model the new logical/deployment view as well as the interfaces of each microservice you introduce.</p>
